export const abstract  = 'Remote user authentication is a mechanism to access information systems via insecure channel from any location. There are a number of various authentication protocols that follow different mechanisms. When communicating via insecure channel, security is the main issue due to the intruders. When communicating via unsecure channel, security is the main issue. Intruders can harm the user\'s information using various techniques even though the user is using an authentication scheme. Although researchers have invented many user authentication schemes to withstand security attacks still many schemes are vulnerable to various attacks. Many authentication schemes have used passwords and smart cards for user authentication. But recently, Instead of passwords and smart-cards now many schemes use bio-metric features for their authentication due to the uniqueness of biometric features. In this research, two-way authentication scheme is considered. We have investigated the key requirement to full fill the security and reliability on “Keystroke Dynamics Based Bio-metric for Remote User Authentication Schemes” referring different authentication schemes. Keystroke dynamics has been use as a biometric feature to authentication the remote user and it was used as a second authentication factor while using password as first authentication factor. We have done several experiments for various algorithms to get the minimum error rate using specific machine learning for data mining, classification toolkit WEKA and python program. Here we have reported all the algorithms and results for different approaches. According to the obtained results this bio-metric feature and proposed authentication mechanism provide an acceptable level of performance.'
